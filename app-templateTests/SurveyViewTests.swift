/// UI Tests for SurveyView - Beyond current scope
/// SurveyView represents the visual survey component with interactive elements for question display,
/// answer input controls, progress indicators, and navigation buttons.
/// Tests would involve SwiftUI view rendering, user interaction simulation, and layout validation.
///
/// NOTE: UI tests for SurveyView are beyond the current scope as they require SwiftUI
/// testing frameworks and UI automation setup. Focus is on ViewModel testing first.
/// When implemented, SurveyView tests would cover:
/// - Question display formatting
/// - Input control rendering (TextField, RadioButton, etc)
/// - Navigation button states (Next/Previous enable/disable)
/// - Progress bar updating
/// - Error display for validation failures
/// - Loading state presentation
/// - Conditional question visibility
/// - Accessibility compliance
/// - Device orientation/responsiveness
